# About EOModeler for OSX

This project has been downloaded in its original form from the WebObjects dev mailing list,
as one member wanted to share his code with the community. Personnaly I used WebObjects
for long time and so I think it's my time to bring to the WO community something back by
hosting this project on my Github account.

Please feel free to fork the project and enhance the EOModeler for OSX to make it better.

Maybe guys from [Project Wonder](https://github.com/wocommunity/wonder "Project Wonder") /
[WOLips](https://wiki.wocommunity.org/display/WOL/Home "WOLips") could give a very appreciated help,
because mainly they have already done the job in WOLips for Eclipse.
I have the chance for me Eclipse/WOLips works and it is a great great job you guys have done there.

Here I quote the author who posted this project on the mailing list:

```
Well I seriously doubt this would really help anyone, but just in case.
Since I seriously hate the Eclipse thing (and it hates me, judging on how well it runs if I have to use the thing),
I am building my apps in Xcode, and editing models manually was a bit of bore; so I spent about two days finishing
a project I have started years ago and never really found a time for, an EOModeller for Mac. Of course, it is
_seriously_ lacking, and there's lots and lots of things it can't do at all; it's a typical in-house quick-and-dirty
job.
Still, in case anyone might get interested, the project (*not* a build! you need Xcode to build it) is freely
available at http://www.ocs.cz/CD/EOModellerOCS.2.0.zip. Should build and work 10.8+ (not tested much). Naturally,
there is no licence at all (the icons are stolen from Apple anyway :)), if you want to, download, and do whatever
you like with the code. There's only one guarantee: it won't work well.

All the best,
OC
