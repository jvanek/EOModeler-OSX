There's no licence for this code, I don't like lawspeak anyway. Simply use it without any limitation in any way you want to, that's all. The only guarantee there is there are bugs in the code :) With any questions or comments, contact me please at ocs (at) ocs (dot) cz.

=== known TODOs ===
- raw dict editor for all items (either improved raw viewer, or text-based)
- model group support
- validations (when saving, before SQL generation, when user asks to, in reasonable extent automatically...)
- reasonable prototype support (can't be done before model groups)
- undo with UserInfo editor
- smart relationship editor, M:N management etc
- fetch spec editor, even if textedit :)
- better SQL generation with customizable templates (perhaps flexible enough for Java generation too, presumed anyone still uses that EOGenerator thing?)
- model creation (which would work, unlike the current model creation :))
- stored procedures... does anybody use the thing?
- entity indexes
=== convenience and aesthetics ===
- make smartsort model-based, not global
- cut/copy/paste/dragdrop model objects
- drag-based relationship creation
- why the hell up/down arrows do not work in attribute/relationship lists?!?

=== 2.3 ===
- implemented copy/paste -- first Q&D attempt, not as smart as should be

=== 2.2 ===
- small fix -- inserting attribs/relationships into entity which did have none now works properly

=== 2.1 ===

- added this History file to keep track of changes and todos
- slightly cleaned up sources, removed some old out-commented nonsense etc, made sure there are no warnings (LLVM 5.1, did not test elsewhere)
- added menu alternatives for toolbar items
- ensured the lists in model window are by default sorted by name
- moved fixed lists to Preferences. No GUI, but added a Prefs window which hints what to do
- activated SQL generation and improved it to support adding columns
- fixed the installed-accessor bug, was not Apple's, but mine all the time. D'oh! Subsequently, had to fix undo, too.

=== 2.0 ===
First published version, somewhat useable, though not much. No documentation at all

=== 1.0 ===
An attempt to create a Modeller ages ago, never really worked :)
